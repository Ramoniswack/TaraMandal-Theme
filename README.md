# TaraMandal

## Short description (one line)

A cosmic-inspired VS Code theme collection with deep-space backgrounds and stellar accents for comfortable, focused coding.

- Terminal color integration for consistent experience
- Lightweight — no runtime dependencies

## Features

- Balanced color contrast for long sessions
- Distinct token colors for readability
- UI theming for panels, status bar and activity bar
- Optional terminal background customizations
