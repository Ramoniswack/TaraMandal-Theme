# TaraMandal Theme

Hey there! Welcome to my cosmic-inspired dark theme for VS Code with stellar accents.

## Features

- **Deep Space Background**: I've crafted a rich dark blue background that's super easy on my eyes during late-night coding sessions
- **Vibrant Syntax Highlighting**: I've personally selected colors for optimal code readability
- **Enhanced Token Differentiation**: I made sure there's clear distinction between different code elements
- **Beautiful UI Elements**: I've designed cohesive styling across all VS Code interface components

4. Click Install
5. Select "TaraMandal" from the theme dropdown (Ctrl+K Ctrl+T or Cmd+K Cmd+T)

If you prefer the manual way (like I sometimes do):

2. In VS Code, go to Extensions view
3. Click the "..." menu in the top-right corner
4. Select "Install from VSIX..."
5. Navigate to the downloaded file and install

## Customization

Not happy with some of my color choices? Feel free to make it your own! Here's how I'd customize it in the `settings.json` file:

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "[TaraMandal]": {
        "comments": "#6B7394",
        "functions": "#3399FF",
        "keywords": "#FF3366",
        "strings": "#4AE54A",
        "types": "#9933FF",
        "variables": "#FFFFFF"
    }
}
```

## Recommended Font

I personally love coding with these fonts:

- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) - my personal favorite
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) - super clean and readable
- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) - great ligatures!
