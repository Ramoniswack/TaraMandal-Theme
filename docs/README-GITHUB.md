# TaraMandal Theme Collection

I created TaraMandal as a small set of VS Code themes inspired by nebulas, auroras and night skies. I ship four variants so you can pick the look that fits your workflow.

## Theme variants I include

- TaraMandal (default) — my original deep-space theme with balanced contrasts.
- TaraMandal Dark — an alternate dark variant tuned for higher contrast in UI elements.
- TaraMandal Light Cream — a warm, easy-on-the-eyes light theme with gentle syntax tones.
- TaraMandal Aurora — a green/teal aurora palette inspired by the northern lights.

## Features

- Thoughtful color design for long sessions
- Distinct token colors to make structure and logic easier to scan
- UI theming for panels, status bar and activity bar
- Optional terminal background customization for the light theme

## Screenshots

I use the screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder. Here are the four theme previews (click any image to view full size):
